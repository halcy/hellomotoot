# Hello MoToot
PSTN Mastodon Client using Mastodon.py and the Twilio API.

Allows for sending messages via SMS and via speech recognition by calling in, and has some additional bonus functions. Live instance: https://mastolab.kal-tsit.halcy.de/day09/

If you want to run this yourself, you need to register for a twilio account. Note that if you do run this yourself, which I doubt anyone will:

* It costs money, twilio is not free.
* Since it is a hosted application, you will neccesarily have data in your DB that grants you access to peoples Mastodon accounts. Please be confident in your ability to not look at this data.
